## 1. Economies of Scale (P.125 (P.30))

Transition of ... given ...

## 2. Productivity (P. 133 (P. 38))

Productivity = Average output per unit of input. 

common practice: Labor resource for measuring productivity

* Total product (TP or Q): Aggregate sum of production of firm during a time period.
* Average product (AP):  TP/total number of units for a give input.
* Marginal product (MP): increment of total output by adding another unit of input.


**Increasing marginal returns**
then, 
**Law of diminishing returns**.



P. 138 (43)
* "MP and AP form the basis for marginal cost (MC) and Average Variable Cost (AVC)"
* "MC and AVC are respective mirror images of MP and AP" (Exhibit 39)



The increases in MP result in declining marginal costs from Q0 to Q1. As MP or productivity peaks at L1, MC is minimized at Q1. Diminishing marginal returns take over in Areas 2 and 3, where a decreasing marginal product results in higher marginal costs.



"When using a combination of resources, a least-cost optimization formula is constructed as follows":

$$\begin{equation}
\frac{M P_{1}}{\text { Price of input } 1}=\ldots=\frac{M P_{n}}{\text { Price of input } n}
\end{equation}$$
