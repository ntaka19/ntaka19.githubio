## 1. Economies of Scale (P.125 (P.30))

Transition of ... given ...

## 2. Productivity (P. 133 (P. 38))

Productivity = Average output per unit of input. 

common practice: Labor resource for measuring productivity

* Total product (TP or Q): Aggregate sum of production of firm during a time period.
* Average product (AP):  TP/total number of units for a give input.
* Marginal product (MP): increment of total output by adding another unit of input.


**Increasing marginal returns**
then, 
**Law of diminishing returns**.



P. 138 (43)
* "MP and AP form the basis for marginal cost (MC) and Average Variable Cost (AVC)"
* "MC and AVC are respective mirror images of MP and AP" (Exhibit 39)

**Productivity and cost:** <br>
* The increases in MP result in declining marginal costs from Q0 to Q1. As MP or productivity peaks at L1, MC is minimized at Q1. Diminishing marginal returns take over in Areas 2 and 3, where a decreasing marginal product results in higher marginal costs.
* As MP or productivity peaks at L1, MC is minimized at Q1. Diminishing marginal returns take over in Areas 2 and 3, where a decreasing marginal product results in higher marginal costs. 

**"Because revenue, costs, and profit are measured in monetary terms, the produc- tivity of the different input factors requires comparison on a similar basis. " (ここの意味がわからない)**
(Per costで考えることによってoutput を量ることができる？)


"When using a combination of resources, a least-cost optimization formula is constructed as follows":

$$\begin{equation}
\frac{M P_{1}}{\text { Price of input } 1}=\ldots=\frac{M P_{n}}{\text { Price of input } n}
\end{equation}$$

An example of above formula using the
two-factor production function
consisting of labor and physical capital: 


$$\begin{equation}
\frac{M P_{L}}{P_{L}}=\frac{M P_{K}}{P_{K}}
\end{equation}$$

($$MP_L$$ and $$MP_K$$ are marginal produccts of labor and physical capital.)

Mechanism: <br>
  1. "if $$MP_L/P_L$$ equals two and $$MP_K/P_K$$ is four, physical capital yields twice the output per monetary unit of input cost versus labor." 
  2. "It is obvious that the firm will want to use physical capital over labor in producing additional output because it provides more productivity on an equivalent cost basis." 
  3.  "However, as more physical capital is employed, the firm’s $$MP$$ of capital declines because the law of diminishing returns impacts production." 
  4. "Physical capital is added until its ratio of MP per monetary unit of input cost matches that of labor: $$MP_K/P_K = MP_L/P_L = 2$$."
