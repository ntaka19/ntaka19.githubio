## 1. Economies of Scale (P.125 (P.30))


## 2. Productivity (P. 133 (P. 38))

Productivity = Average output per unit of input. 

common practice: Labor resource for measuring productivity

* Total product (TP): Aggregate sum of production of firm during a time period.
* Average product (AP): = TP/total number of units for a give input
* Marginal product (MP): increment of total output by adding another unit of input.


**Increasing marginal returns**
then, 
**Law of diminishing returns**.
