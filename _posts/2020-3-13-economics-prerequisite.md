Following article constitues my notes on prerequisite material on Ecomomics given from the CFAI and can be found [here](https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/support/programs/cfa/prerequisite-economics-material-demand-and-supply-analysis-intro.ashx):

Another helpful reference is from [Mark Meldrum's set of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pitQYVFgibs&list=PLM9WI-4yn8BIkIVB9yfFcTVKT3uO_d3hZ&index=4).


$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t}= \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
\left[ K(\theta) \left (\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} + 1 \right) \right]\
\end{align*}

## Various Profits

- Accounting profit:
- Economic profit:
- Normal profit:

## Revenue and Cost

| Revenue | Cost |
----|---- 
| Total Revenue (TR)  | Total Cost (TC) |
| Average Revenue (AR)  | Average Total Cost (ATC) [^1]|
|   | Average Fixed Cost (AFC) |
|   | Average Variable Cost (AVC) |
| Marginal Revenue (MR) | Marginal Cost (MC) |

[^1]: Total Cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost


Here, "Average" means averaging by supplied quantity. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial TC}{\partial Q} = \frac{\partial }{\partial Q} \frac{TC}{Q} \\
\frac{1}{Q} \frac{\partial TC}{\partial Q} + TC(-\frac{1}{Q^2}) \leq 0 \\
\frac{\partial TC}{\partial Q} \leq \frac{TC}{Q} \\
MC  \leq ATC
\end{aligned}
$$


## Under Perfect Competition
Under perfect competition, we assume that all are firms price takers.
Market equilibrium decides price value for every firm. Therefore price is kept constant regardless of the quantity demanded for individual firms.

It is important to distinguish between market demand curve and firm's demand curve. They are very very different!

(Price taker: Agent in which )

Therefore below equation holds,

$$
\begin{equation}
Price = AR = MR
\end{equation}
$$
