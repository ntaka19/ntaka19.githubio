Following article constitues mainly notes on prerequisite material on Ecomomics given from the CFAI and can be found here:


$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t}= \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
\left[ K(\theta) \left (\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} + 1 \right) \right]\
\end{align*}
$$

## Profit

Accounting profit:
Economic profit:
Normal profit:




## Revenue and Cost

| Revenue | Cost |
----|---- 
| Total Revenue (TR)  | Total Cost (TC) |
| Average Revenue (AR)  | Average Total Cost (ATC) [^1]|
|   | Average Fixed Cost (AFC) |
|   | Average Variable Cost (AVC) |
| Marginal Revenue (MR) | Marginal Cost (MC) |

[^1]: Total Cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost


Here, "Average" means averaging by supplied quantity. 



## Under Perfect Competition
Under perfect competition, we assume that all are firms price takers.
Market equilibrium decides price value for all firms and for each firm, the price is kept constant.

(Price taker: Price is given 


Therefore, 


$$
\begin{equation}
Price = AR = MR
\end{equation}
$$
