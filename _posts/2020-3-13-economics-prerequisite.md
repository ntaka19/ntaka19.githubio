Following article constitues my notes on prerequisite material on Ecomomics given from the CFAI and can be found [here](https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/support/programs/cfa/prerequisite-economics-material-demand-and-supply-analysis-intro.ashx)

## 1. Various Profits

- Accounting profit:
- Economic profit:
- Normal profit:



## 2. Revenue and Cost

| Revenue | Cost |
----|---- 
| Total Revenue (TR)  | Total Cost (TC) |
| Average Revenue (AR)  | Average Total Cost (ATC) [^2]|
|   | Average Fixed Cost (AFC) |
|   | Average Variable Cost (AVC) |
| Marginal Revenue (MR) | Marginal Cost (MC) |

[^2]: Total Cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost


Here, "Average" means averaging by supplied quantity. 
"Marginal" can be easily grasped by partial derivative by Q. For example, marginal cost is defined as, 
$$ \frac{\partial TC}{\partial Q} $$.




Below is the derivation of relationship between cost curves given in the prerequisite material:\\
"Mathematically, when marginal cost is less than average variable cost, AVC will be decreasing. The opposite occurs when MC is greater than AVC."

(TVC: Total Variable Cost. )

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\partial AVC}{\partial Q} = \frac{\partial }{\partial Q} \left( \frac{TVC}{Q} \right) \\
& \frac{1}{Q} \frac{\partial TVC}{\partial Q} + TVC(-\frac{1}{Q^2}) \leq 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

therefore, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\partial TVC}{\partial Q} = \frac{\partial TC}{\partial Q} \leq \frac{TVC}{Q} \\
& MC  \leq AVC
\end{aligned}
$$

From the derivation, it is easy to see that relation between MC and ATC is equivalent with AVC (AVC can also be replaced with ATC). 
Since the relation holds for opposite inequality, 
intersection between MC curve and AVC (ATC) is the miniumum point of AVC (ATC).

## 3. Under Perfect Competition
Under perfect competition, we assume that all are firms price takers.
Market equilibrium decides price value for every firm. Therefore price is kept constant regardless of the quantity demanded for individual firms.

It is important to distinguish between market demand curve and firm's demand curve. They are *very very different*!

(Price taker: Agent in which )

Therefore below equation holds,

$$
\begin{equation}
Price = AR = MR
\end{equation}
$$
