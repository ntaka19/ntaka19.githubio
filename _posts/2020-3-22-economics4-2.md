## GDP


### Expenditure approach

$$
\begin{equation}
GDP = C+I+G+(X-M)
\end{equation}
$$

* C: consumption spending
* I: business investment
* G: Government purchases (investment + consumption)
* X: exports
* M: imports

外需と内需<br>
- C+I+G: 内需
- X-M: 外需 (2字目で覚えるe**x**ports, i**m**ports)

### Income approach


$$
\begin{equation}
GDP = \text{national income}+\text{capital consumption allowance}+\text{statistical discrepancy}
\end{equation}
$$


### Saving (P. 56)


**Total income:** 
$$
\begin{equation}
GDP = C+S+T
\end{equation}
$$

* C: consumption spending
* S: household and business savings
* T: net taxes (taxes paid miunus transfer payments received)



$$\begin{equation}
C+I+G+(X-M) = C+S+T
\end{equation}$$

therefore,

$$\begin{equation}
S = I+(G-T)+(X-M)
\end{equation}$$

Saving is used by "investment", "government deficits", "claims(請求) against foreginers"(=Net exports)

or, 

$$\begin{equation}
(G-T)=(S-I)-(X-M) 
\end{equation}$$



## Aggregate demand and supply


## IS curve

$$\begin{equation}
(S-I)=(X-M)+(G-T) 
\end{equation}$$

* $$S-I$$ : "excess saving" or "insufficient expenditure"

* Decrease in real interest rate
* Increase in income increases
