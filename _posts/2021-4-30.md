## Fundamental theorem of asset pricing

1.  The First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: A discrete market,
    on a discrete probability space
    $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P})$$, is arbitrage-free if, and
    only if, there exists at least one risk neutral probability measure
    that is equivalent to the original probability measure, P.

2.  The Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: An arbitrage-free
    market (S,B) consisting of a collection of stocks S and a risk-free
    bond B is complete if and only if there exists a unique risk-neutral
    measure that is equivalent to P and has numeraire B.
