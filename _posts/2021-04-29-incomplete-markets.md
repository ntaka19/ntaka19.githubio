## Fundamental theorem of asset pricing

-  The First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: A discrete market, on a discrete probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F, \mathcal{P)$, is arbitrage-free if, and only if, there exists at least one risk neutral probability measure that is equivalent to the original probability measure, P.

-  The Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: An arbitrage-free market (S,B) consisting of a collection of stocks S and a risk-free bond B is complete if and only if there exists a unique risk-neutral measure that is equivalent to P and has numeraire B.
