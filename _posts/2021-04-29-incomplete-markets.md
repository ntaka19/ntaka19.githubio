\subsection{Fundamental theorem of asset pricing}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: A discrete market, on a discrete probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P})$, is arbitrage-free if, and only if, there exists at least one risk neutral probability measure that is equivalent to the original probability measure, P.

\item The Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: An arbitrage-free market (S,B) consisting of a collection of stocks S and a risk-free bond B is complete if and only if there exists a unique risk-neutral measure that is equivalent to P and has numeraire B.
