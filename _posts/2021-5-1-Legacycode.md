## Objective
- To refactor/add modules quickly and without causing any bugs or syntax errors (includes "local" syntax/rules)


1. Dealing with legacy codes involves asking questions. 

How to ask efficient questions?
Before that, you need to be clear what you would like to acheive by asking those questions.

- Restrictions. Allowed syntax.
- What existing modules can you use?
- Where to implement your new module?


At what point do you ask? 
- When you think special knowledge is needed to understand the code and that you do not possess the knowledge. 
(Special knowledge may be when )



2. How to dig in. 

- 呼び出し履歴を追う。
- 階層が深い場合はどうするか？
メモをとる？

- Error catch構文が置かれているところは「節点」である？
