## Reading 13 The Firm and Market Structures 


Fill in the below table.

 \  |Perfect competition (完全競争) | Monopolistic competition (独占的競争) | Oligopoly (寡占) | Monopoly (独占)
----|----|----|----|---- 
**Number of Sellers** |Many | Many | Few | Few 
**Barriers to entry** |very low | low | high | very high 
**Nature of substitute products** | very good substitutes| good but differentiated| very good or differentiated | no good substitutes 
**Nature of competition**| Price only | price, marketing , features |  price, marketing , features| advertising 
**Pricing Power**| None | some | some to significant | significant 
**Examples**| Wheat in region  | Tooth paste industry | Car, oil | Electricity 

* perfect : 完全競争 . All others are imperfect competition!
* monopolistic: 独占的競争. Many sellersは"competition"で覚える． 
* oligopoly: 寡占
* Monopoly: 独占

Most theories of perfect competition are covered in prerequisite material: 
([post 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/economics-prerequisite)

### 13.2 Monopolistic Competition


- Downward sloping demand curve. 

Relation with Demand Curve and MR: 
* In perfect competition,  demand curve = market price = MR (traits of Price-taker. ("take" the market price.)) 
* For imperfect competition, MR starts at the same point as demand curve. However, MR is steeper than demand curve (=AR). 
  * $$AR = TR(=P \times Q)/Q$$ so $$AR$$ is a demand curve.
  * $$AR>MR$$ at all points because, $$TR$$ curve has decreasing slope throughout. Q-TR curveが上に凸で，二回微分が負だから，$$\frac{\partial TR}{\partial Q}$$ はずっと減少している．(See further exhibit 6 in prerequisite material) 
  * Example: <br> 
  $$\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}Q_{D}=40-5 P \\ 5 P=40-Q \quad P=8-\frac{1}{5} Q \\ T R=P \times Q=\left(8-\frac{1}{5} Q\right) Q \\ 
  =8 Q-\frac{1}{5} Q^{2} \\ MR=\frac{d T R}{d Q} = 8-\frac{2}{5} Q\end{array}
  \end{equation}$$


Factors Long run equilbrium comparision (LOS 13.e):
* markup (値上げ)
* excess capacity or an inefficient economic scale of production. 
* product innovation is necessary. close substitutes and imitations emerge.
  * optimal: marginal cost of (additional) innovation = marginal revenue of (additional) innovation
* High Advertising expenses
* Brand names.

Optimal price and output for firms under each market structure.


## 13.3 Oligopoly (寡占)

* Firms are **interdependent** so a price change by one firm can be expected to be met by a price. 4 different models: 
  1. Kinked demand curve:  
  2. Cournot duopoly model:
  3. Nash equilbrium model:General type of Cournot duopoly.
  4. Stakelberg dominant firm model: Price




## 13.4 Monopoly (独占)

* afa

$$\begin{equation}
MR = P(1-\frac{1}{E_p})
\end{equation}$$

where, $$E_p$$ is the absolute value of the price of elasticity of demand at price = P. 

In comparision with perfect competition:
* **Dead weight loss** (Difference from sum of maximum consumer and supplier surplus.)
  * Can be reduced with multiple pricing

Natural Monopoly:
* Given the economy of scale (Downward ATC. more production, less per cost), 
* Monopolists produce *less* than **optimal quantity**
  * because monopolists want $$MR = MC$$. Maximum surplus is attained in perfect competition where **Demand curve(=Marginal Benefit $$\neq$$ MR)=MC=(supply curve)**. 
  Given price, marginal costs determine how much the firm is willing to supply(少し考えたら分かる).  
* Pricing regulation by government for allocative efficiency[^1] (because monopolists produce *less* than **optimal quantity**)
  * Average cost pricing: Reduce price to where ATC intersects market demand curve. ensure normla profit because p = ATC.
  * Marginal cost pricing: MC intersects market demand curve. 



### Reason why supply curve cannot be determined in imperfect competition.



**Perfect competition** <br>
* Demand curve in perfect competiton $$P = MR = \text{constant}$$
* Supply curve (short run) in perfect competiton $$P = MC$$ (Segment above shutdown or AVC in short term). (Horizontal sum of supply curve of all firms gives  market supply curve.)
  1. A **profit-maximizing** firm produces the quantity of output that equates marginal revenue and marginal cost (MR = MC).
  2. A perfectly competitive firm is characterized by the equality between price and marginal revenue (P = MR). P is constant nevertheless the quantity (=price taker).
  3. The law of diminishing marginal returns gives the marginal cost curve a positive slope.
  - Combining all three points: **profit-maximizing** perfectly competitive firm **produces** the quantity of output that equates price and marginal cost (P = MC).
  Which is basically the definition of supply curve.
   [reference](https://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=perfect+competition,+short-run+supply+curve).


**Imperfect competition:** (P.42) <br>
1. In all cases, profit maximization is given at $$MR=MC$$. Here, profit maximizing quantity $$Q$$ is determined.
2. In the imperfect competition, demand curve does not equal MC because as demand curve is down sloped.  
3. Find price at $$Q$$ computed in 1 in the demand curve to obtain $$P$$. Plotting ($$P, Q$$) yields supply curve of the firm. (Profit maximizing $$Q$$ for a given price)
4. However, there is no one to one relationship between $$P$$ and $$Q$$ because different slopes of demand curve can be given. 
Therefore supply curve is not unique. 

“As a result, shifts in demand do not trace out a series of prices and quantities as happens with a competitive supply curve.”
[reference](http://www.economicsdiscussion.net/monopoly/constructing-a-supply-curve-under-monopoly/17069)

* No well defined supply function. $$Q = f(P)$$.[ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXds8b9Z03w)
  * In competition, $$P=MR=MC$$, $$P=MC(Q)$$.  



## Pricing strategy of each market structure (LOS 13.f )

 \  | Perfect competition | Monopolistic competition | Monopoly 
----|----|----|---- 
**Pricing** | P = MR = MC | P > MR = MC | P> MR = MC  

In the case of oligopoly price is dependent on other firms.

\ | Oligopoly(寡占)
----|---- 
**Kinked demand curve** | Price changes when competitior decreases their price.
**Collusion** | Share market to maximize total industries. Produce total quantity for which MR = MC and charge the price from industry demand curve. Share resulting economic profit. 
**Dominant firm model** | Leader firm has lowest cost & largest share. Leader: MR=MC to compute quantity, use firm demand curve to compute price. Follower: Use the price determined to compute quantity. (firm demand curves are different among leader and followers)  [ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E76nSY1RW0c) 
**Game theory** | Nash equilbrium

## Concentration measures (LOS. 13.g)

1. N-firm concentation ratio: sum of top N firm shares in ratio to total firm shares.
2. Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI): squared-sum of top N firm shares in ratio to total firm shares. Sensitive to merger.
