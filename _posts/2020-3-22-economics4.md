## Reading 13 The Firm and Market Structures 


Fill in the below table.

 \  |Perfect competition | Monopolistic competition | Oligopoly | Monopoly
----|----|----|----|---- 
**Number of Sellers** |Many | Many | Few | Few 
**Barriers to entry** |very low | low | high | very high 
**Nature of substitute products** | very good substitutes| good but differentiated| very good or differentiated | no good substitutes 
**Nature of competition**| Price only | price, marketing , features |  price, marketing , features| advertising 
**Pricing Power**| None | some | some to significant | significant 
**Examples**|  | Tooth paste industry | Car, oil | 

* perfect : 完全競争 . All others are imperfect competition!
* monopolistic: 独占的競争 
* oligopoly: 寡占
* Monopoly: 独占

Most theories of perfect competition are covered in prerequisite material:

### 13.2 Monopolistic Competition


- Downward sloping demand curve. (price searcher)

Relation with Demand Curve and MR: 
* In perfect competition,  demand curve = market price = MR (traits of Price-taker) 
* For imperfect competition, MR starts at the same point as demand curve. However, MR is steeper than demand curve (=AR). 
  * $$AR = TR(=P \times Q)/Q$$ so $$AR$$ is a demand curve.
  * $$AR>MR$$ at all points because, $$TR$$ curve has decreasing slope throughout. Q-TR curveが上に凸で，二回微分が負だから，$$\frac{\partial TR}{\partial Q}$$ はずっと減少している．(See further exhibit 6 in prerequisite material) 


Long run equilbrium comparision:
* markup (値上げ)
* excess capacity or an inefficient economic scale of production. 
* product innovation is necessary. close substitutes and imitations emerge.
  * optimal: marginal cost of (additional) innovation = marginal revenue of (additional) innovation
* High Advertising expenses
* Brand names.

Optimal price and output for firms under each market structure.


## 13.3 Oligopoly

* Firms are indeterdependent
* Kinked demand curve
