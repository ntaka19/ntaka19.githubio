## Reading 13 The Firm and Market Structures 


Fill in the below table.

 \  |Perfect competition | Monopolistic competition | Oligopoly | Monopoly
----|----|----|----|---- 
**Number of Sellers** |Many | Many | Few | Few 
**Barriers to entry** |very low | low | high | very high 
**Nature of substitute products** | very good substitutes| good but differentiated| very good or differentiated | no good substitutes 
**Nature of competition**| Price only | price, marketing , features |  price, marketing , features| advertising 
**Pricing Power**| None | some | some to significant | significant 
**Examples**|  | Tooth paste industry | Car, oil | 

* perfect : 完全競争 . All others are imperfect competition!
* monopolistic: 独占的競争 
* oligopoly: 寡占
* Monopoly: 独占

Most theories of perfect competition are covered in prerequisite material:

### 13.2 Monopolistic Competition

Functional differences between perfect competition:

* Downward sloping demand curve. (price searcher)
*  Relation with Demand Curve and MR
  * In perfect competition,  demand curve = market price = MR (traits of Price-taker) 
  * However, in monopolisitic,
  * MR starts at the same point as demand curve. However, MR is steeper. 
    * $$AR = TR/Q$$ so it is a demand curve.
    * $$AR>MR$$ at all points because, $$TR$$ curve has decreasing slope throughout. Q-TR curveが上に凸で，二回微分が負だから，$$\frac{\partial TR}{\partial Q}$$ はずっと減少している．
