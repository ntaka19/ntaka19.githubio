## Fixed Income

1.  Bond that promises series of interest payments in fized amounts and repay the princical amount at maturity.  
  - Increase in market interest rates(i.e. yields on bonds), decreases present value of bonds.(the ones bought before the change in yields.) 

2. Bonds rate based on their relative probability of default. Compensation of risk with yields. Decrease in bond rating decreases price, thus increasing the yield.



* zero coupon bonds (pure discount bonds)
