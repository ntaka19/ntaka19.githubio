## Two main factors of bonds 

1.  Bond that promises series of interest payments in fized amounts and repay the princical amount at maturity.  
  - Increase in market interest rates(i.e. yields on bonds), decreases present value of bonds.(the ones bought before the change in yields.) 

2. Bonds rate based on their relative probability of default. Compensation of risk with yields. Decrease in bond rating decreases price, thus increasing the yield.



* zero coupon bonds (pure discount bonds)
 


## Issuance and Trading of bonds 


 \  | Issued by | Denominated | Market
----|----|----|---- 
**Domestic bonds** | Domestic | Domestic | Domestic
**foreign bonds** | Foreign | Domestic | Domestic
**Eurobonds** | Outside Jurisdiction of any one country | Foreign B | Foreign (not B)


- A **global bond** is issued simultaneously in the Eurobond market and in at least one domestic bond market.
([Ref](http://remington-work.blogspot.com/2009/07/foreign-vs-euro-vs-global-bonds.html))


  - "A French company that issues bonds in Japan denominated in U.S. dollars has issued a Eurobond, more specifically, a **Eurodollar bond**. Other types of Eurobonds are the Euroyen and Euroswiss bonds.
A **global bond** is similar to the Eurobond but can also be traded and issued simultaneously in the country whose currency is used to value the bond. Drawing from our Eurobond example above, an example of a global bond will be one in which the French company issues bonds denominated in the U.S. dollar but offers the bonds in both Japan and U.S. markets."
([Reference:Investopia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/globalbonds.asp))


- Domestic bond and foreign bonds are within the national bond market (Domestic bond market).


Examples:
- Foreign bonds: Panda bonds, yankee bonds, Samurai bond (覚え方: ""サムライ"の国で債券を発行する"と外国人が言った。)
- "Eurobond, more specifically, a Eurodollar bond. Other types of Eurobonds are the Euroyen and Euroswiss bonds."
