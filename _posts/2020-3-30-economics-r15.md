## Business Cycle

Aspects:
* xx = Inventory-Sales ratio (inventory/sales)


1. Trough (不況)
  - GDP growth rate changes from negative to positive
  
2. Expansion (回復)
  - GDP growth rate increases. 
3. Peak (好況)
  - Sales growth begins to slow (and inventories accumulate)
4. Contraction/recession (後退)


1. Housing sector activity
*  Mortgage rates: Low -> increase home buying construction.
*  Housing costs (Home and including mortgage financing costs) to relative income: home buying and construction. 
*  Speculative activity:  

**LOS. 15.c Theories of business cycle** <br>

1. Neoclassical school (新古典学派)
2. Keynesian school
3. Monetarist school
4. New Keynesian school
5. Austrian school
6. New classical school (新しい古典派)



**15.f construction of indexes**

* CPI (Consumer Price Index): 
* PPI: calculated from prices of goods in process. different stages of processing.
* WPI:






**LOS 16.n Describe limitations of monetary policy**

1. Decrease money supply by setting higher interest rate (To slow down the economy)
2. People expect lower future inflation rate.
3. Long-term rates (refers to government bonds maturing in 10 yrs) could fall.
  * *Because* long-term bond yields include premium for expected inflation
4. Facilitates towards *increase* of econ growth.

Equivalent explanation:
* Bond market participants think short term rates are already too high.
  * Therefore, authorities are risking a recession.
  * Central bank will likely undershoot inflation target. → Fall in inflation expectations.

* **Bond market vigilantes** reduce their demand for long-term bonds to push up their yields.

* Liquidity trap
  * Highly elastic demand for money. (Interest rate vs. quantity)








 **LOS. 18.j Explain the effects of exchange rates on countries' international trade and capital flows**


### Elasticities Approach 

Effect of currency depreciation in terms of current accounts(経常収支). 

**Marshall-Lerner condition**:

= The condition under which a depreciation of the domestic currency will decrease a trade deficit.

$$\begin{equation}
W_X \epsilon_X + W_M (\epsilon_M-1) > 0
\end{equation}$$

- $$W_X$$ : proportion of total exports.
- $$\epsilon_X$$: absolute value of price elasticity of demand for exports.



### Absorption Approach

The effect of currency depreication in terms of capital account. 


$$\begin{equation}
BT = Y - E
\end{equation}$$

- Y: domestic production of goods and services of national income
- E: Domestic absorption(=内需＝総支出) of goods.
- BT: Balance of trade

BT<0 shows the state of trade deficit.
